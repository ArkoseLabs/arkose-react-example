# arkose-react-example

This example project provides a simple React component that wraps the Arkose Labs Client API. The component takes in a number of properties that are used to generate the necessary script tags within the DOM to both load the Arkose Labs API and also configure it using a JavaScript function that is automatically called by the Client API.
